#CSC309 Project Proposal

## Ideas 
- Sports portal where users can post games for pick-up, shimmy etc. 
- Team management application (example: for dragon boat team, can include workout programs, announcements, carpool signups, socials)

## High Level Description 
>A paragraph or two describing the topic of your application. What is the overall purpose of your application? Who does it serve? Explain at a high level what users will be able to do using your application.

Purpose: 
Users: 

## User Iteractions
>A detailed list of the user interactions with the application. How will you get data into your application? What are all the different things a user will do when they use your application?

## Sketches
>Sketches of what the views will look like to the user. These do not have to be fancy polished drawings, or HTML mockups. They must be legible, but they could be scanned hand drawings.
