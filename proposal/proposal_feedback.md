üëã Hello, here is some (hopefully) helpful feedback to help position your group to do well on the final project, from the perspective of a TA.

## Overall, At First Glance
The proposal looks good. It seems like the scope of the project is minimized well, to complete it on time. It's surprising how quickly time flies in this project. 

As you already know, one of the most important things for a successful outcome is to divide the tasks amongst team members well, and to decide what things are unimportant to submit as part of the "minimum viable product" approach for this final project. I recommend diving up this work as soon as possible, if it hasn't already been done üëç

## Reassurance/Encouragement
I should also provide reassurance that it's okay to not implement certain aspects. For example if it seems overly time-intensive to implement a system to manage user's avatars on the server, it's okay to just use a generic placeholder image instead of implementing this functionality.. This style of thinking can be followed for other things too..

As a general rule, it's better to omit non-core features that are time-intensive, with some explanation in the final documentation like, "in a full version of the application, we would also add the following features..." than it is to have some half-implemented bits and pieces in an app.

## Suggestions
Bootstrap (or other similar) is helpful to use for the components. I think it makes it easier by eliminating the need to reinvent the wheel (building standard components from scratch). And it saves time (and your sanity) rather than having to fiddle with things like background color, and shadows, when there is lots more work to be done implementing important features of the app.

I do recommend the practice of making the frontend responsive, since almost any respectable thing is responsive in this era of web apps. (The UI components can be basic, and don't worry about supporting too many widths -- three, like in lab2 is more than enough.) I'm sure the group already are aware of this by now but in case not, if the app is going to be made responsive, I think it's easier to start doing it right from the very beginning (than trying to fiddle with things later)... Note: I say all this with reservation because IIRC responsiveness does not factor into the marks.

With messaging, groups often decide whether they need to implement real-time or notifications. The key here is that these features are not necessary for doing a high grade on the project. Although if there is time, then that's great!

I'm not sure the scrollbar in some of the sketches is necessary if the content is allowed to expand to its full height.

The sketches look nice :-)
